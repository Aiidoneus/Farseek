- New simplified method patching system with better mod compatibility and possibly better performance. Only Farseek needs a coremod now; dependent mods only need a config file.
- Possibly fixed [a performance issue with the structure chunk cache](https://github.com/delvr/Farseek/issues/22).
- Possibly fixed [a performance issue with TFC's worldgen](http://terrafirmacraft.com/f/topic/8470-solved7920-tfc-generating-chunks-off-into-the-ocean-performance-craters/#comment-110835) that can help Streams generation in particular.
- Added `mcmod.info` metadata generation for this and dependent mods.
- _Not_ backwards-compatible with Farseek 1.x.
