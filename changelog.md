- Fixed [a crash caused by unused Farseek/Streams/Repose jars in "mods/" subdirectories](https://github.com/delvr/Streams/issues/52).
- Fixed [a crashed caused by recursive chunk generator creation with mod combinations such as ComputerCraft + Mo'Creatures](https://github.com/delvr/Streams/issues/53).
