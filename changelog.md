- New simplified method patching system with better mod compatibility. Only Farseek needs a coremod now; dependent mods only need a config file.
- Fixed [crashes with mods having @Optional dependencies](https://github.com/delvr/Farseek/issues/14) (such as WAILA or TheOneProbe) when these dependencies are missing.
- Fixed a [server crash with Water Strainer](https://github.com/delvr/Farseek/issues/19).
- Added `mcmod.info` metadata generation for this and dependent mods.
- _Not_ backwards-compatible with Farseek 1.x.
